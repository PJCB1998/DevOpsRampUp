## Challenges 

  - In this challenge youâ€™ll need to replicate the configurations you made in the scripting challenge using a configuration management tool:

  - Choose a SCM Tool to use in the project: Each tool has its advantages and disadvantages so, explain why you made that decision. Just like the Scripting challenge, create the code to provision your instance with     everything the app needs to work but, in this case, using the tool you chose. Remember that your instances are now in the cloud and they should be disposable, meaning you should be able to destroy and recreate them anytime you want. Your implementation needs to able to detect if a new instance was created and configure it accordingly.
  
  - Try to provision the servers from your local machine.
